## Little Critters

# Description of the Website

Our website Little Critters is meant for entertainment and is heavy on interaction. Inspired by the popular handheld game Tamagotchi, it is an RPG game in which the player is taking care of a digital pet called a “critter”. When the player first opens the website, they will have to proceed to the Little Critter webpage via the egg icon in the navigation bar, and will be prompted with various critters with different appearances to choose from. After the player has selected their starting pet, the pet will be situated in the middle of the window in the Little Critter webpage, and its statistics and “emotions” may be inferred as well from the unique animations that will show from the pet.

Some of the things that the player can do in the game are feeding the pet, playing with it, giving it accessories, and bathing it, corresponding to all of its statistics or “basic needs.” The pet will have four main numerical statistics (abbreviated as “stats” hereon): hunger, hygiene, love, and energy; the pet eats, sleeps, and needs attention from the player for the whole game. With all four stats beginning at 100 initially, these four stats will decrease in value as time goes on, and will eventually reach the minimum of 0 if the player does not tend to their pet for long enough. When all stats reach the value of 0, the pet will “run away” and the player will have to obtain a new pet (which the website will provide through another prompt). However, if the player manages to successfully keep their pet healthy, the game will continue for an indefinite period of time. (Progress will be saved even after the player exits the website; pet statistics will freeze once the user exits.)

# Outline of the Website

## 1. Homepage (accessed via home icon in navbar)
   This page will be the first page that will show up for the user once they first enter   the website. Updates and previews of the game will be shown here in the form of a “gallery” showcase, where each post/update will have an image and a caption. The user may toggle through posts with the use of the arrows at both sides of the post.
## 2. Little Critter (accessed via egg icon in navbar)
   This is where the “digital pet” of the user actually resides, in the middle of the screen. There will be 4 designated status bars for each of  the pet’s statistics, and one button catering to each statistic: “Feed” (for hunger), “Clean” (for hygiene), “Play” (for love), and “Sleep” (for energy). An inventory for all of the food items (randomly given to the user depending on how long they have the tab open for) is also provided near these buttons.
## 3. Instructions (accessed via question mark icon in navbar)
   This page will contain all of the guidelines and tips for caring for the digital pet. There will be an introductory paragraph as a preview to the game, and below it there will be the actual rules and instructions for the game. The manual will come in the form of a “gallery” as well (with there being a heading, text, and a picture at the right side of the text) where each section is dedicated to one topic (for example, introduction to the pet stats or how to maintain the pet stats) that can be navigated with the buttons at the left and right of the divider.

# JS Incorporation


JavaScript will be included in the program by setting functions to use information that the user inputs and having it affect the pet’s as well as other factors in the game’s condition. Data such as hunger, rest, and sleep will be determined using Javascript by asking the user to feed, hydrate, clean, and let the pet rest by doing multiple actions. Since these actions will affect the pet’s numerical stats, functions to add and subtract from the stats will be used. Other actions in the game, such as “play”, will influence the stats of the pet throughout the game and will need functions since it will be affecting the pet throughout the game.
